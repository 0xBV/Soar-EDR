## ‚öôÔ∏è SOAR-EDR Automation Project
This project demonstrates an end-to-end security orchestration and automation workflow using LimaCharlie (EDR) and Tines (SOAR) to detect, notify, and optionally isolate endpoints upon detection of malicious activity

## üìå Playbook Objective
Send a Slack message to the user containing information about detections generated from LimaCharlie (EDR).  Generates a user prompt from Tines (SOAR) for playbook orchestration to optionally isolate the affected workstation.
Message to the user contain these fields:
- Time
- Hostname
- Source IP
- Process
- Command Line
- File Path
- Sensor ID
- Link to Detection (If applicable)

## üõ†Ô∏è Technologies & Tools
- LimaCharlie EDR ‚Äì Detection source and host isolation

- Tines SOAR ‚Äì Orchestration and Slack/email-driven response

- Slack API ‚Äì User notification and approval workflow

- Email Notifications ‚Äì Automated alert delivery

## Generating telemetry for Detection Rule creation
I generated an event in LimaCharlie by triggering the execution of the "LaZagne.exe" program.  This program can be used maliciously for credential harvesting post-exploitation.
MITRE ATT&CK Information:
